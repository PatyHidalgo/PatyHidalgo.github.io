### Biography

Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez holds a Ph.D. and two M.Sc. from the University of California, 
Berkeley (Energy and Resources and Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences). 
She graduated as an Industrial and Electrical engineer from Pontificia Universidad 
Católica of Chile. She is an NSF GRFP fellow, Siebel Scholar in Energy, Rising Star 
in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and has been awarded the UC Berkeley 
Graduate Opportunity Program Award, and the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award 
(for teaching Convex Optimization). She has served as Best Paper Session Judge and co-Chair, 
and Paper Forum Chair at the 2019 and 2020 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM). 
She is one of the academic co-leads of the IEEE Power & Energy Society Task Force “Data-Driven 
Controls for Distributed Systems”. She is the director of the Renewable Energy and Advanced Mathematics 
(REAM) lab at UCSD. 

### Research interest

Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez’s work focuses on high penetration of 
renewable energy using optimization, control theory and machine learning. She co-developed 
the first stochastic power system expansion model to study the Western North America’s grid under 
climate change uncertainty. She also works on power dynamics with low and variable inertia, 
and controller design using machine learning and safety guarantees. She is generally 
interested in power dynamics, energy policy, electricity market redesign for the integration 
of renewable energy, microgrids, transmission and distribution systems, and learning 
for dynamical systems with safety guarantees. Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez enjoys teaching 
convex optimization, control theory and power systems. Email: phidalgogonzalez at eng.ucsd.edu
