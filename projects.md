The REAM lab  has a myriad of projects that analyze renewable energy integration, ranging from long-term planning to real-time operations. The following is a non-exhaustive list of research threads:
* Long-term planning in power systems
* Real-time operations of grids with high penetration of renewable energy
* Development and application of machine learning and AI methods for power systems controller design using safety guarantees from control theory
* Electricity market redesign for the efficient integration of renewable energy
* Distributed energy resources deployment (e.g. to mitigate wildfire risk), operation and tariff schemes designs
