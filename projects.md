The REAM lab  has a myriad of projects that analyze renewable energy integration, ranging from long-term planning to real-time operations. The following is a non-exhaustive list of research threads:
* Long-term planning in power systems
* Real-time operations of grids with high penetration of renewable energy
* Development and application of machine learning and AI methods for power systems controller design using safety guarantees from control theory
* Electricity market redesign for the efficient integration of renewable energy
* Distributed energy resources deployment (e.g. to mitigate wildfire risk), operation and tariff schemes designs

### Stochastic Long-term Power System Planning in Western North America under Climate Change

Typical electricity-grid capacity expansion models make investment decisions with fixed inputs (e.g., 
fixed electricity demands and hydro-power availability). The resultant electricity supply system may 
not be robust to future climate change-driven uncertainties in energy demand and supply. We present the first 
climate change stochastic long-term (2050) capacity expansion and operation electricity grid model for the 
Western North America electricity region, with high temporal and spatial resolution. The Stochastic SWITCH 
WECC model generates a least cost portfolio of power plants that is robust to varying future climate 
conditions using a multi-stage optimization approach with varying electricity-demand and hydropower-availability 
inputs under three climate change scenarios. Results show that an optimal robust electricity supply portfolio 
in the WECC for 2050 has about 4% higher overall installed capacity than the average mix of the three 
scenarios modeled separately, and about 5.6% higher installed gas capacity, due to the greater need for 
operational flexibility under the wider range of possible conditions.


### Wildfire risk mitigation

Electricity market design to allow the participation of distributed energy resources (DER) 
and microgrids in the market (TSO-DSO coordination). The objective of this work is to design
 an effective scheme to aid the penetration of DER independently and within microgrids, while 
 at the same time ensuring reliability in the events of wildfire.Â
