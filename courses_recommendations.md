### Convex Optimization for Engineers

This course focuses on convex optimization theory, convexification of non-convex problems, 
engineering applications, modeling and implementation in a programming language (MATLAB or choice). 
This course covers: convex sets and functions, convex optimization problems (LP, QP, SOCP, SDP, 
robust and stochastic optimization), weak and strong duality, optimality conditions (complementary 
slackness, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker), and solution and shadow price interpretation. Some applications 
include: design in mechanical engineering, optimal control problems, machine learning, energy, 
transportation, etc. 

Prerequisites: nongraduate students may enroll with consent of instructor.


### Modern Power Systems

The objective of this seminar is to introduce students to the research field of integration
of renewable energy (RE) in power systems. This course covers some relevant literature 
and the state of the art in the following subareas related to RE integration: capacity 
expansion models, optimal power flow, power dynamics, electricity markets, RE variability 
and forecasting, learning and AI for power systems, microgrids and islanded grids, 
electrical vehicles and demand response, among others.
 
Prerequisites:  nongraduate students may enroll with consent of instructor.
