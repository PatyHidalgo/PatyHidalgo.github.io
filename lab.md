She graduated as an Industrial and Electrical engineer from Pontificia Universidad 
Católica of Chile. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md).

**Research:** She is generally interested in power dynamics, energy policy, electricity market redesign for the integration 
of renewable energy, microgrids, transmission and distribution systems, and learning 
for dynamical systems with safety guarantees. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md) and [projects](projects.md).

**Fun fact:** Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez attends silent 10-day meditation courses.

### Ph.D. students
 

#### Manasa Muralidharan

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Manasa.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Manasa Muralidharan (she/her) is a PhD Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department 
at UCSD co-advised by Prof. Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez and Prof. Jan Kleissl. She graduated 
with a Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering with Distinction from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham 
(University), Coimbatore, India in 2017. She was a study-abroad student at UCSD for the 
last 3 semesters of her undergraduate study. Her undergraduate research project was on 
studying the impact of shading from rooftop solar photovoltaics on building heating and 
cooling energy use and costs.

**Research:**  Manasa is broadly interested in distributed control, optimization and learning 
for power grids with a high share of renewable and distributed energy resources.
Her earlier research work was on optimal control for battery energy storage systems. 
As a part of an ARPA-E OPEN project, she developed a system-level optimal controller for a 
novel heterogeneous unifying battery system that improves state-of-health uniformity, 
performance and reliability of 2nd-life electric vehicle batteries.
Her current research focuses on frequency control. As a part of an ARPA-E NODES project, 
she developed a power flow model of the UCSD microgrid to test microgrid response to a 
secondary frequency regulation request from the grid operator. She also contributed to 
one of the first real-world, large-scale demonstrations of distributed secondary 
frequency control using heterogeneous distributed energy resources on the UCSD microgrid. 
Her current research includes distributed frequency control and safety-guaranteed 
learning-based frequency control for power grids with low and time-varying inertia.

**Fun fact:** Manasa is a classically-trained and passionate dancer. She is currently a part 
of an all-women Bachata dance team with a local dance company and performs at different 
Latin dancing events in San Diego

#### Natalia Gonzalez

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Natalia_Gonzalez.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>


**Bio:** Natalia (she/her) is a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego studying mechanical engineering
 with a focus on control theory and machine learning. She graduated from the University 
 of Florida with an BS in MAE. Natalia also earned a minor in sustainability and the built 
 environment, which provided her with an alternative perspective on the challenges associated 
 with developing a more sustainable built environment, as well as a top-level overview of 
 the effects of climate change and the strategies being employed to mitigate it globally. 
 Her undergraduate research project was a case study on the German energy transition. Her 
 research provided a comprehensive review and discussion of the significant socio-technical
  roles that power production and the grid, buildings, and the public have played in the 
  energy transition. She is extremely passionate about the environment and climate change 
  mitigation, which motivates her to contribute to a more sustainable energy future through research.
  
  
**Research:** Natalia’s research focuses on renewable integration into power systems 
through optimization, control, and machine learning/AI. She believes that 100% renewable 
power capacity is possible through the optimized integration of distributed energy resources, 
strategic planning of electricity and energy markets, and the utilization of robust design 
that accounts for the uncertainties of climate change. Natalia is also interested in energy 
policy and the role of AI in sustainable development. Furthermore, she loves to teach and 
mentor students, and she is especially dedicated to uplifting historically underrepresented 
engineers through mentorship and education.

**Fun fact:** Natalia has worked on several off-grid permaculture farms to learn about sustainable 
agricultural practices and community living. "Chop wood, carry water."

#### Paul Serna-Torre

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Paul_Serna-Torre_2.jpg" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Paul is a graduate student (Mechanical Engineering PhD., track: Energy) 
at UC San Diego advised by Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez. He graduated with highest 
honors as an Electrical Engineer from Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería of Peru. 
For one year, Paul worked on electricity pricing at the Peruvian Energy Commision (Osinergmin).
 At this institution, Paul codeveloped the "Perseo 2.0" model that is a hydrothermal economic 
 dispatch model for electricity tariffs of Peru. In the pursuit of more challenges, 
 Paul began working at the Peruvian Electricity Operator (Coes) in 2018. At Coes, 
 for three years, Paul enjoyed working on electrical analysis and short-term power 
 optimization of the Peruvian system. In addition, with the guidance of Wilfredo Sifuentes, 
 he teamed up with four engineers to develop the "Yupana" model that is the official 
 short-term power generation scheduling model of Peru..

**Research:** Paul is zestfully learning on optimization, electricity markets, 
power system dynamics and the decarbonization of power systems. He is particularly 
interested in leveraging Operations Research-based methods (e.g. Benders Decomposition, 
Non-linear methods, MILP) to optimize and control energy systems. Moreover, 
Paul formed a predilection for teaching and mentoring students, so he is always 
looking for new opportunities to teach and help students.

**Fun fact:** For Paul, biking and going jogging are the best ways to refresh his 
entangled ideas and to create novel energy solutions.

### M.S. students
 



### Undergraduate students
 

#### Martin Staadecker

**Bio:**  I'm an undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto planning to specialize in robotics. Most recently, I was a 
technical lead at Flatten, a Canadian non-profit where we built a data-collection 
platform to help governments respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Research:** I'm interested in projects where I can learn something new 
while having a positive impact. Modelling the energy grid with the REAM Lab 
is perfect as our work directly impacts policy decisions and eventually carbon emissions.

**Fun fact:** Last year I went outdoor rock climbing in Mexico and I can't wait to go back!
