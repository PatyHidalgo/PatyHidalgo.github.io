### Principal Investigator
 

#### Dr. Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/2019_Hidalgo-Gonzalez.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Dr. Hidalgo-Gonzalez is an Assistant Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and in 
the Center for Energy Research at UC San Diego. She holds a Ph.D. and two M.Sc. from the University of California, 
Berkeley in Energy and Resources and Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. 
She graduated as an Industrial and Electrical engineer from Pontificia Universidad 
Cat√≥lica of Chile. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md).

**Research:** She is generally interested in power dynamics, energy policy, electricity market redesign for the integration 
of renewable energy, microgrids, transmission and distribution systems, and learning 
for dynamical systems with safety guarantees. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md) and [projects](projects.md).

**Fun fact:** Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez attends silent 10-day meditation courses.

### Ph.D. students
 

#### Manasa Muralidharan




### M.S. students
 

#### Aditya Kulkarni

**Bio:** I'm a graduate student at the ECE department UC San Diego with major focus
 on deep learning and machine learning. I really enjoy learning and applying ML and 
 deep learning to a wide variety of problems. Importantly, I feel that this technology 
 has a pivotal role in making human activities more efficient (less exacting on nature). 
 Prior to this I worked full time developing algorithms and hardware for 5G modems at 
 MediaTek. I hold a bachelor's degree in ECE from R.V College of Engineering, India.
 
**Research:** I'm very much interested in solving ecological problems using AI. 
Currently at REAM lab working towards making renewables an integral part of our 
energy by predicting the power consumption dynamics. Previously I worked on using 
deep learning for remote sensing to assist large scale and efficient agricultural 
decision making. 

**Fun fact:**  I can converse in 5 languages, the fifth one is python!

#### Noah Sterngold

**Bio:** Noah is an M.S. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at
 UC San Diego. He also works for the Coastal Observing Research & Development Center 
 (CORDC) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, analyzing fishing vessel behavior
  and building systems to help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. 
  Before graduate school, he spent four years working in the Investment Banking Division 
  of Goldman Sachs. He graduated with High Honors from Swarthmore College in 2014, 
  obtaining a B.S. in Engineering and a B.A. in Economics.
  
**Research:** Noah is broadly interested in machine learning, from its theoretical underpinnings 
to the design and construction of novel machine learning systems. He especially 
enjoys working on unsupervised systems that are able to extract meaning without 
labels, and on the data systems that allow for efficient training and inference. 
His current work is focused on the application of recurrent, generative models to 
real data in order to provide practical insights.  

**Fun fact:**  Noah is a member of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society along with his grandfather, Henry, class of 1943!

### Undergraduate students
 

#### Martin Staadecker

**Bio:**  I'm an undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto planning to specialize in robotics. Most recently, I was a 
technical lead at Flatten, a Canadian non-profit where we built a data-collection 
platform to help governments respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Research:** I'm interested in projects where I can learn something new 
while having a positive impact. Modelling the energy grid with the REAM Lab 
is perfect as our work directly impacts policy decisions and eventually carbon emissions.

**Fun fact:** Last year I went outdoor rock climbing in Mexico and I can't wait to go back!
