#### Manasa Muralidharan

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Manasa.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Manasa Muralidharan (she/her) is a PhD Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department 
at UCSD co-advised by Prof. Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez and Prof. Jan Kleissl. She graduated 
with a Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering with Distinction from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham 
(University), Coimbatore, India in 2017. She was a study-abroad student at UCSD for the 
last 3 semesters of her undergraduate study. Her undergraduate research project was on 
studying the impact of shading from rooftop solar photovoltaics on building heating and 
cooling energy use and costs.

**Research:**  Manasa is broadly interested in distributed control, optimization and learning 
for power grids with a high share of renewable and distributed energy resources.
Her earlier research work was on optimal control for battery energy storage systems. 
As a part of an ARPA-E OPEN project, she developed a system-level optimal controller for a 
novel heterogeneous unifying battery system that improves state-of-health uniformity, 
performance and reliability of 2nd-life electric vehicle batteries.
Her current research focuses on frequency control. As a part of an ARPA-E NODES project, 
she developed a power flow model of the UCSD microgrid to test microgrid response to a 
secondary frequency regulation request from the grid operator. She also contributed to 
one of the first real-world, large-scale demonstrations of distributed secondary 
frequency control using heterogeneous distributed energy resources on the UCSD microgrid. 
Her current research includes distributed frequency control and safety-guaranteed 
learning-based frequency control for power grids with low and time-varying inertia.

**Fun fact:** Manasa is a classically-trained and passionate dancer. She is currently a part 
of an all-women Bachata dance team with a local dance company and performs at different 
Latin dancing events in San Diego

#### Natalia Gonzalez

**Bio:** Natalia (she/her) is a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego studying mechanical engineering 
with a focus on control theory, optimization, and modeling. She completed her MS in MAE at 
UC San Diego in March 2023. She graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Florida 
with an BS in MAE. Natalia also earned a minor in Sustainability and the Built Environment, 
which provided her with an alternative perspective on the challenges associated with developing 
a more sustainable built environment, as well as a top-level overview of the effects of 
climate change and the strategies being employed to mitigate it globally. Her undergraduate 
research project was a case study on the German energy transition. Her research provided 
a comprehensive review and discussion of the significant socio-technical roles that 
power production and the grid, buildings, and the public have played in the energy transition. 
She is extremely passionate about the environment and climate change mitigation, which motivates 
her to contribute to a more sustainable energy future through research.

**Research:** Natalia’s research focuses on renewable integration into power systems 
through optimization, control, and machine learning/AI. She believes that 100% renewable 
power capacity is possible through the optimized integration of distributed energy resources, 
strategic planning of electricity and energy markets, and the utilization of robust design 
that accounts for the uncertainties of climate change. Her most recent work explores the 
role that emerging technologies may play in a decarbonized grid using capacity expansion modeling. 
Natalia is also interested in energy policy, environmental justice implications of various 
decarbonization pathways, and the role of AI in sustainable development. Furthermore, she 
loves to teach and mentor students, and she is especially dedicated to uplifting historically 
underrepresented engineers through mentorship and education.

**Fun fact:** Natalia has worked on several off-grid permaculture farms to learn about sustainable 
agricultural practices and community living. "Chop wood, carry water."

#### Paul Serna-Torre

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Paul_Serna-Torre_2.jpg" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Paul focuses on the control of Distributed Energy Resources and the planning of 
power systems expansion. Before joining the Ph.D. program, Paul held appointments in industry for five years. 
He initially worked on designing power transformers for distribution grids. Then, Paul worked in the 
Tariff Regulatory Direction of the Peru Energy Commission (Osinergming). Paul, there, codeveloped 
the "Perseo 2.0" model, a midterm power system optimization model considering the vast hydro grid 
with reservoirs and rivers in Peru. Then, Paul worked in the Peru National Electricity Operator (Coes). 
Paul performed the nationwide short-term power generation scheduling and the security analysis of the national 
grid with stability and contingency analysis. With the guidance of Dr. Wilfredo Sifuentes, he teamed up 
with four engineers to develop the "Yupana" model, Peru's official short-term power generation scheduling model. 
Paul completed a Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics, focusing on numerical optimization and the theory 
of probabilities. Paul completed a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, graduating with highest honors, 
from Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería of Peru.

**Research:** Paul is interested in controlling Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) using 
Machine Learning and Game Theory for frequency and voltage regulation.
Paul is also working on analyzing the grid expansion of North American Western 
Interconnection towards 2050, considering zero emissions,
the impact of storage costs declining and decreasing transmission capacity.

**Fun fact:** Paul really enjoy playing soccer and having good meals.

### M.S. students



### Undergraduate students
 

#### Martin Staadecker

**Bio:**  I'm an undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto planning to specialize in robotics. Most recently, I was a 
technical lead at Flatten, a Canadian non-profit where we built a data-collection 
platform to help governments respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Research:** I'm interested in projects where I can learn something new 
while having a positive impact. Modelling the energy grid with the REAM Lab 
is perfect as our work directly impacts policy decisions and eventually carbon emissions.

**Fun fact:** Last year I went outdoor rock climbing in Mexico and I can't wait to go back!
