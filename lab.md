<img align="left" src="/assets/img/2019_Hidalgo-Gonzalez.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Dr. Hidalgo-Gonzalez is an Assistant Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and in 
the Center for Energy Research at UC San Diego. She holds a Ph.D. and two M.Sc. from the University of California, 
Berkeley in Energy and Resources and Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. 
She graduated as an Industrial and Electrical engineer from Pontificia Universidad 
Católica of Chile. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md).

**Research:** She is generally interested in power dynamics, energy policy, electricity market redesign for the integration 
of renewable energy, microgrids, transmission and distribution systems, and learning 
for dynamical systems with safety guarantees. For more info refer to her [bio](phg.md) and [projects](projects.md).

**Fun fact:** Professor Hidalgo-Gonzalez attends silent 10-day meditation courses.

### Ph.D. students
 

#### Manasa Muralidharan


#### Shiny Choudhury

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Shiny_Choudhury.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Shiny (she/her) is a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego's MAE department. She graduated from 
UC Irvine with an MS in MAE, where she conducted her research at the UCI Combustion Lab. Her
 thesis was a part of a California Energy Commission-funded project focused on renewable fuel
  interchangeability analysis (experiments and numerics) for stationary combustion devices. 
  While at UCI, Shiny also spearheaded a collaboration on building a campus-wide load 
  (heating, cooling, and electric) forecast model for the central plant using deep learning. 
  She holds an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering from the CET Bhubaneshwar in India. 

**Research:** Shiny is driven by the urgency of global warming and believes that resilient 
and high penetration renewable energy infrastructure are necessary to a) electrify as much 
of global energy as possible, b) fulfill the increasing heating and cooling demands, and 
c) eventually lead to net-zero emissions. To that end, she is interested in the theoretical
 modeling of energy systems using optimization, controls, and machine learning/AI. Shiny 
 is also interested in exploring the trade-off pertaining to 100% automation of smart grids 
 vs. a human controller making a certain percentage of decisions from long-term grid 
 stability and grid safety point of view. 

**Fun fact:** Shiny oscillates between yoga and kickboxing to clear her mind and get new ideas!

#### Paul Serna Torre

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/Paul_Serna-Torre.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Paul is a graduate student (Mechanical Engineering PhD., track: Energy) 
at UC San Diego advised by Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez. He graduated with highest 
honors as an Electrical Engineer from Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería of Peru. 
For one year, Paul worked on electricity pricing at the Peruvian Energy Commision (Osinergmin).
 At this institution, Paul codeveloped the "Perseo 2.0" model that is a hydrothermal economic 
 dispatch model for electricity tariffs of Peru. In the pursuit of more challenges, 
 Paul began working at the Peruvian Electricity Operator (Coes) in 2018. At Coes, 
 for three years, Paul enjoyed working on electrical analysis and short-term power 
 optimization of the Peruvian system. In addition, with the guidance of Wilfredo Sifuentes, 
 he teamed up with four engineers to develop the "Yupana" model that is the official 
 short-term power generation scheduling model of Peru..

**Research:** Paul is zestfully learning on optimization, electricity markets, 
power system dynamics and the decarbonization of power systems. He is particularly 
interested in leveraging Operations Research-based methods (e.g. Benders Decomposition, 
Non-linear methods, MILP) to optimize and control energy systems. Moreover, 
Paul formed a predilection for teaching and mentoring students, so he is always 
looking for new opportunities to teach and help students.

**Fun fact:** For Paul, biking and going jogging are the best ways to refresh his 
entangled ideas and to create novel energy solutions.

### M.S. students
 

#### Aditya Kulkarni

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/aditya.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** I'm a graduate student at the ECE department UC San Diego with major focus
 on deep learning and machine learning. I really enjoy learning and applying ML and 
 deep learning to a wide variety of problems. Importantly, I feel that this technology 
 has a pivotal role in making human activities more efficient (less exacting on nature). 
 Prior to this I worked full time developing algorithms and hardware for 5G modems at 
 MediaTek. I hold a bachelor's degree in ECE from R.V College of Engineering, India.
 
**Research:** I'm very much interested in solving ecological problems using AI. 
Currently at REAM lab working towards making renewables an integral part of our 
energy by predicting the power consumption dynamics. Previously I worked on using 
deep learning for remote sensing to assist large scale and efficient agricultural 
decision making. 

**Fun fact:**  I can converse in 5 languages, the fifth one is python!

#### Noah Sterngold

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/noah2.png" width="300" style="padding-bottom: 10px;" style="padding-right: 10px;"/>

**Bio:** Noah is an M.S. candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at
 UC San Diego. He also works for the Coastal Observing Research & Development Center 
 (CORDC) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, analyzing fishing vessel behavior
  and building systems to help combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. 
  Before graduate school, he spent four years working in the Investment Banking Division 
  of Goldman Sachs. He graduated with High Honors from Swarthmore College in 2014, 
  obtaining a B.S. in Engineering and a B.A. in Economics.
  
**Research:** Noah is broadly interested in machine learning, from its theoretical underpinnings 
to the design and construction of novel machine learning systems. He especially 
enjoys working on unsupervised systems that are able to extract meaning without 
labels, and on the data systems that allow for efficient training and inference. 
His current work is focused on the application of recurrent, generative models to 
real data in order to provide practical insights.  

**Fun fact:**  Noah is a member of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society along with his grandfather, Henry, class of 1943!

### Undergraduate students
 

#### Martin Staadecker

**Bio:**  I'm an undergraduate student in the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto planning to specialize in robotics. Most recently, I was a 
technical lead at Flatten, a Canadian non-profit where we built a data-collection 
platform to help governments respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Research:** I'm interested in projects where I can learn something new 
while having a positive impact. Modelling the energy grid with the REAM Lab 
is perfect as our work directly impacts policy decisions and eventually carbon emissions.

**Fun fact:** Last year I went outdoor rock climbing in Mexico and I can't wait to go back!
