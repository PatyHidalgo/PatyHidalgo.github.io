The REAM laboratory aims to aid the integration of renewable energy (RE) in power systems by
developing and applying methods drawing from control theory, machine learning and AI, and optimization.
Our mission is two-fold:  

<ul>
  <li>Develop mathematical tools to solve engineering challenges related to RE</li>
  <li>Develop solutions that can be implemented in real-life power systems</li>
</ul>
